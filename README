This is a temporary fork of md5-hbf. We will merge... One day :)
md5 hardware bruteforcer IP core

we use the pancham MD5 IP core made by Swapnajit Mittra <http://www.angelfire.com/ca/verilog>
we plan on changing the MD5 IP core, since this one limits the design speed to 38 MHz which is slow.
however a md5 hash is computed each 68 clock rising edge, which is pretty fast (in particular compared to implentations in software using modern CPU).

Supported Boards:
 - Digilent: Spartan 3E Starter Kit (500K gates) => Run without any problems at 50MHz !
 - Avnet: Spartan 3A Evaluation Board (400K gates) => Seems to run correctly at 46MHz !
 - Xilinx: Spartan 3AN Starter Kit (700K gates)
 - Digilent: Spartan 3E Basys (250K gates) => Only mono-core
 - Digilent: XUPV2P Virtex 2-Pro XCV2P30 => Draft not working very very buggy !

Synthesis : 

usart output works and shows the cleartext password when bruteforcing reveals a md5 hash collision.

HOW-TO Synthetize ?

	1°) Install ISE Webpack from xilinx website (free of charge)
	2°) type in your terminal : $source /path/to/xilinx/dir/settings32.sh
	3°) go to md5-hbf base directory
	4°) type ./build_bitstream.sh
	5°) drink some (a lot of) coffee, cause you'll have to wait 'till the synthesis is done.

Simulation : 

it has been tested using iverilog (vvp) and gtkwave

More information : 

This design compares a given md5 hash with the hash of all alpha numeric strings of length equal to 8.
At the moment the hash is hardcoded in the verilog design code.

Actually, 64 characters are tested for each byte of the 8-byte string.
Those characters are : a to z, A to Z, 0 to 9, '!' and '.'
They can be easily changed by editing the file named "ram.data", each line corresponds to the hexadecimal representation of an ascii character.
Those characters are put in blockram to access them quickly and easily inside the FPGA chip.
